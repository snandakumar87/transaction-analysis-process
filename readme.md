Transaction Analytics
=======================

This example showcases simple orchestration of Business Rules using a Business Process. The incoming transactions are evaulated against 4 rules.
1) Inconsistency Check
2) Merchant Category Check
3) Due Diligence Check
4) Risk Check

Based on these, if any of these checks fail, the task is assigned to a user to work on (investigator group).
